      The Toyota Land Cruiser (Japanese: トヨタ・ランドクルーザー, Hepburn:
      Toyota Rando-Kurūzā) (also sometimes spelled as LandCruiser)[1] is a
      series of four-wheel drive vehicles produced by the Japanese automobile
      manufacturer Toyota. It is Toyota's longest running series of models.[2]
      As of 2019, the sales of the Land Cruiser totalled more than 10 million
      units worldwide.[3] Production of the first generation of the Land Cruiser
      began in 1951.[3][4][5] The Land Cruiser has been produced in convertible,
      hardtop, station wagon and cab chassis body styles. The Land Cruiser's
      reliability and longevity have led to huge popularity, especially in
      Australia, where it is the best-selling body-on-frame, four-wheel drive
      vehicle.[6] Toyota also extensively tests the Land Cruiser in the
      Australian outback – considered to be one of the toughest operating
      environments in both temperature and terrain.[7][8][9] In Japan, the Land
      Cruiser was once exclusive to Toyota Japanese dealerships called Toyota
      Store.
