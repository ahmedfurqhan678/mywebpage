    <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
    <p id="intro">
      Dinosaurs are a diverse group of reptiles[note 1] of the clade Dinosauria.
      They first appeared during the Triassic period, between 243 and 233.23
      million years ago (mya), although the exact origin and timing of the
      evolution of dinosaurs is a subject of active research. They became the
      dominant terrestrial vertebrates after the Triassic–Jurassic extinction
      event 201.3 mya and their dominance continued throughout the Jurassic and
      Cretaceous periods. The fossil record shows that birds are feathered
      dinosaurs, having evolved from earlier theropods during the Late Jurassic
      epoch, and are the only dinosaur lineage known to have survived the
      Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event approximately 66 mya. Dinosaurs can
      therefore be divided into avian dinosaurs—birds—and the extinct non-avian
      dinosaurs, which are all dinosaurs other than birds. Dinosaurs are varied
      from taxonomic, morphological and ecological standpoints. Birds, at over
      11,000 living species, are among the most diverse groups of vertebrates.
      Using fossil evidence, paleontologists have identified over 900 distinct
      genera and more than 1,000 different species of non-avian dinosaurs.
      Dinosaurs are represented on every continent by both extant species
      (birds) and fossil remains. Through the first half of the 20th century,
      before birds were recognized as dinosaurs, most of the scientific
      community believed dinosaurs to have been sluggish and cold-blooded.
